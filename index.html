        <p class="aboutText">
          We are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early
          following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, we were
          distinguished by our extended compositions, sonic experimentation,
          philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. We became a leading
          band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest
          progressive rock band of all time.

        <p class="aboutText">
          Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals),
          Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals) and Richard
          Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released
          two hit singles, "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play", and the
          successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967).
          Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in January 1968; Barrett
          left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became
          the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind
          Pink Floyd's most successful albums, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973),
          Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The
          musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd â€“ The Wall (1982), won two
          BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.

        <p class="aboutText">
          Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed
          by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined
          later by Wright. They produced the albums A Momentary Lapse of Reason
          (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), backed by major tours, before
          entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a
          performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in
          2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The
          Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the
          Division Bell recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed
          Pink Floyd to release the song "Hey, Hey, Rise Up!" in protest at the
          Russian invasion of Ukraine.
